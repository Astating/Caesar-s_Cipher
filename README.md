## Four basic ruby projects :

Four projects proposed in *The Odin Project* curriculum.

<ol> <h3><li> Caesar's Cipher :</h3>
Where  I made good use of the <b><i>.ord</i></b> and <i>.<b>chr</b></i> methods and learned that <b>-1 % 26 = 25</b>, which meant my function also worked with a negative shift.

``` ruby
caesar_cipher("What a string!", -1)
#=> "Vgzs z rsqhmf!"

caesar_cipher("What a string!", 4)
#=> "Alex e wxvmrk!"
```
### <li> Sub Strings :
*SOON*

### <li> Stock Picker :
*SOON*

### <li> Bubble Sort :
*SOON*
